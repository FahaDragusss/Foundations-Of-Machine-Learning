This is a linear regression model I have implemented in python using only pure python.
To challenge my skills and understanding I implemented every mathmatical fuction of 
such as Matrix operations, statistical operations.
Part of the challenge was also not using NumPy and Pandas. Yes not using two of the most
fundemental libraries. After the implementation I appreciate these libraries alot.
